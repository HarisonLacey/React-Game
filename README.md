# React Card Game

This React App is a game I created for my level 2 task 12 assignment. It is a variation of the card game 21.

## Installation

Once folder is open in your IDE install the relevant modules by typing npm install in your terminal.

Run the app by typing npm start in terminal.

## Rules

The object of the game is to get your cards to add up to 21 or as close as possible. 

Click the 'Hit Me' button to get dealt a hidden card.

Click the 'Show' button to view your selection as well as your opponent's selection.

Click the 'Reset' button to reset the game.
